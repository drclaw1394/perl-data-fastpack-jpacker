TITLE
    Data::FastPack::JPacker - backend class for packing FastPack data files
    into web loadable JPack

SYNOPSIS
      use Data::FastPack::JPacker;

      my @pairs=("input/path", "output/location");

      my %options=();

      my $jpacker=Data::FastPack::JPaker->new(%options)
      $jpacker->pack_files(@pairs);

DESCRIPTION
    Backend to the fastpack-split program. Splits input files or standard
    input (assumed FastPack messages/frames) in to output files encoded in
    JPack. A sequence of files may be created representing a single input
    file. The resulting jpack files are loadable via JPack in the browser

API
  new
    Create a new packer. No arguments

  init
      $jpacker->init( OPTIONS )

    Initializes a packer with the options (key value pairs) given

    The options to this are

    html_container
        The path to the root dir or 'index.html' file in the root of the
        html directory. Data will be stored relative to the container

    jpack_options
        Options specific to the JPack encoding. Please refere to Data::JPack
        for more details

    message_limit
        Maximum number of FastPack messages to store in an output file

    read_size
        Size of read buffer in bytes. Default is 4096*8

    write_size
        Size of buffer to accumulate output before writing out to disk.
        Default is 4096*8

   pack_files
    Takes a list of pairs (input, output) files and converts them according
    to the options initially set up for the object.

    Output files sequences is calculated for each file, so multiple files
    can be added to the output location without knowledge of the current
    count
